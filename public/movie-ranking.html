<h2>My Top 3 Nollywood movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The sons of Caliphate</h3>
<p>This movie is a perfect depiction of the happenings in Nigeria Political space.</p>
<h3>Sista</h3>
<P>I love the simplicity and relatability of the struggle in the average Nigerian home perfectly depicted in the movie.</P>
<h3>If I am President</h3>
<p>Ayoola Ayoola's delivery in this movie was too impeccable to be ignored. I also fell head over heels because of the political theme of the movie.</p>
